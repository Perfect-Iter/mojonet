When you create a new site you get two keys:

//Private key //


Only you have it
◦ Allows you to sign new content for
your site.
◦ No central registry
It never leaves your computer.
◦ Impossible to modify your site
without it.


//Public key//



This is your site address
◦ Using this anyone can verify if the
file is created by the site owner.
◦ Every downloaded file is verified,
makes it safe from malicious code
inserts or any modifications.


MOJONET  uses the same elliptic curve
based encryption as in your Bitcoin
wallet.
◦ You can accept payments directly to
your site address.
◦ Using the current fastest
supercomputer, it would take around 1
billion years to "hack" a private key.
