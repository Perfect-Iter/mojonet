//Each visited site is also served by you.//
//Every site contains a content.json file which holds all other files in a sha512 hash//
//A signature generated using the site's private key.

//If the site owner (who has the private key for the site address) modifies the site,//
//then he/she signs the new content.json and publishes it to the peers//
//Afterwards, the peers verify the content.json integrity (using the signature), //
//they download the modified files and publish the new content to other peers.//
