//WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU VISIT A MOJONET SITE//

Gathering visitors IP addresses:

Asks visitors IP addresses from the BitTorrent trackers.
◦ Also registers you as a visitor.
◦ Tracker-less peer exchange also supported.

//Downloading site's files//


Downloads a file named content.json, which holds all other filenames, hashes and the site owner's cryptographic signature.
2. Verifies the downloaded content.json file using the site's
address and the site owner's signature from the file.
3. Downloads other files (html, css, js,...) and verifies them using
the SHA512 hash from the content.json file.



◦ The browser is notified immediately about
the file changes using the WebSocket API.
This allows real-time updated sites.
◦ Multi-signature sites are also possible.
◦ For faster and easier data access the json
files can be automatically mapped to a
built-in SQL database.
