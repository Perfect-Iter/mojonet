mojoNet is a decentralized web-like network of peer-to-peer users.its built in Python; and is fully open source. Instead of having an IP address, sites are identified by a public key (specifically a bitcoin address). The private key allows the owner of a site to sign and publish changes, which propagate through the network. Sites can be accessed through an ordinary web browser when using the ZeroNet application, which acts as a local webhost for such pages. In addition to using bitcoin cryptography, mojoNet uses trackers from the BitTorrent network to negotiate connections between peers. mojoNet is not anonymous by default, but it supports routing traffic through the Tor network.

The mojoNet website and bittorrent tracker are blocked in mainland China. Despite the censorship, however, it's still possible to access mojoNet from behind the Great Firewall of China, even over Tor, by bootstrapping over Meek, and connecting to peers directly.

The feasibility of peer-to-peer online web-sites had been hypothesised for some time, with The Pirate Bay suggesting they would build a network, as well as BitTorrent Inc. which created the closed-source Project Maelstrom.Another application, Beaker Browser, uses the P2P DAT files protocol to allow the creation, hosting and serving of websites without need of a server.

There is  no way to take down a mojoNet page which still has seeders, thus making such pages immune to third-party methods of taking them down, including DMCA takedown notices. By default, sites have a size limit of 10 megabytes, but users may grant a site permission to use more storage space if they wish.
