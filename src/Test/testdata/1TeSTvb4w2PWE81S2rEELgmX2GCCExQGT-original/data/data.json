			"body": "What is it good for?\n\n - It allows you to have multi-user sites without need of a bot that listen to new user registration requests.\n - You can use the same username across sites\n - The site owner can give you (or revoke)  permissions based on your mojoID username\n\nHow does it works?\n\n - You visit an authorization provider site (eg mojoid.bit)\n - You enter the username you want to register and sent the request to the authorization provider site owner (mojoid supports bitmessage and simple http request).\n - The authorization provider process your request and it he finds everything all right (unique username, other anti-spam methods) he sends you a certificate for the username registration.\n - If a site trust your authorization provider you can post your own content (comments, topics, upvotes, etc.) using this certificate without ever contacting the site owner.\n\nWhat sites currently supports mojoID?\n\n - You can post comments to mojoBlog using your mojoID\n - Later, if everyone is updated to 0.3.0 a new mojoTalk is also planned that supports mojoID certificates\n\nWhy is it necessary?\n\n - To have some kind of control over the users of your site. (eg. remove misbehaving users)\n\nOther info\n\n - mojoID is a standard site, anyone can clone it and have his/her own one\n - You can stop seeding mojoID site after you got your cert"
